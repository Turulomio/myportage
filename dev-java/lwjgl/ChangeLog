*lwjgl-2.8.2 (19 Nov 2011)

  19 Nov 2011: James Le Cuirot <chewi@aura-online.co.uk>
  +lwjgl-2.7.1-r1.ebuild, +lwjgl-2.8.2.ebuild, -lwjgl-1.0.ebuild,
  -lwjgl-1.0_beta3.ebuild, -lwjgl-2.6-r1.ebuild, -lwjgl-2.7.1.ebuild,
  -files/fix-linux-build.patch:
  Version bump to 2.8.2. This version doesn't currently work with Minecraft
  but adding it anyway. It supports OpenGL ES through the egl USE flag.
  Backport Java 7 jawt loading fix to 2.7.1. Kill off the older versions.

*lwjgl-2.7.1 (2 Jun 2011)

  2 Jun 2011: James Le Cuirot <chewi@aura-online.co.uk>
  +lwjgl-2.7.1.ebuild:
  Version bump to 2.7.1. Seems to work with Minecraft.

  5 Feb 2011; James Le Cuirot <chewi@aura-online.co.uk>
  -lwjgl-2.4.2-r1.ebuild, lwjgl-2.6-r1.ebuild:
  Remove 2.4 now that 2.6 has been confirmed to work better with Minecraft. I
  attempted to cross-compile the native library but it didn't work due to a
  call to "uname" so now we just build it manually instead, avoiding that and
  all the other issues.

*lwjgl-2.4.2-r1 (30 Dec 2010)
*lwjgl-2.6-r1 (30 Dec 2010)

  30 Dec 2010; James Le Cuirot <chewi@aura-online.co.uk>
  -lwjgl-2.4.2.ebuild, -lwjgl-2.6.ebuild, +lwjgl-2.4.2-r1.ebuild,
  +lwjgl-2.6-r1.ebuild:
  The xrandr application is required at run-time, as well as libXrandr.

*lwjgl-2.4.2 (19 Dec 2010)
*lwjgl-2.6 (19 Dec 2010)

  19 Dec 2010; James Le Cuirot <chewi@aura-online.co.uk>
  +lwjgl-2.4.2.ebuild, +lwjgl-2.6.ebuild:
  Version bump and major cleanup. 2.4.2 is provided for Minecraft. Not sure
  why it takes so long to build the native part. Seems to just sit there for
  most of it. Did look at tests but they all require X or certain hardware.

  22 Jan 2009; Alistair Bush <ali_bush@gentoo.org> metadata.xml,
  lwjgl-1.0.ebuild:
  QA Fixes.
