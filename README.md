Turulomio personal portage

We are removing bad ebuilds from master

If the ebuild is interesting, we must create a new branch with the fullname of the ebuild

It's important to merge from master to branch, tu update status of master, remaining in merge ebuilds especific of the branch

I used the option 
`git merge --no-ff master`
